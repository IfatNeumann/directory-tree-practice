# Directory Tree Practice

I've created this game for the girls I teach in [Alicecode](https://alicecode.org/en) to help them practice the topic of paths of files, and how to connect between files, in an enjoyable way!

## Getting Started

Link to the game can be found [here](https://directory-tree-practice.netlify.app/)!

The code is divided into two directories: `Game` and `Project`.
`Game` is divided into three directories:
- `BackgroundImages` - images visualizing the game excercises
- `CodeImages` - screenshots of code snippets of the excercises and the directory tree the game is based on
- `ExerciseHtmls` - the html files of the game itself

Under `Project` you can find all the files, as they appear in the `CodeImages` screenshots.

### You can contribute!

I still need to figure out the whole "open source in git" concept, but this game has not yet reached it's full potential!
Whether you want to practice html, css and js, or just passioate about this game as I am - you can help me make it better!

#### A few improvement ideas:
- A nicer text box for answers - maybe even on the image itself (with "coding font" like [Izayoi Monospaced](https://www.fontspace.com/izayoi-monospaced-font-f32299))
- A better sidebars: the current one overrides the page + the sidebar is hard coded in each page
- An automatic transfer to the next page when the answer was correct
- A start button at the buttom of the main page, leading to the first excercise
